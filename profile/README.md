# LibreConnect Platform
LibreConnect Platform is an open-source project aimed at improving the healthcare sector by facilitating the decentralisation and centralisation of medical data. The platform enables hospitals and healthcare professionals to collaborate effectively by sharing patient medical records, while integrating and analysing data from various external sources to improve the quality of care and data science research.

## Current problem
Hospitals and healthcare structures currently have their own IT infrastructures and systems, which makes it difficult to decentralise data and collaborate between different structures. This limits the effectiveness of care and complicates patient management.
